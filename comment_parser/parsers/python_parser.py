"""This module provides methods for parsing comments from Python scripts."""

import io
import tokenize
from comment_parser.parsers import common

def extract_comments(code):
  """Extracts a list of comments from the given Python script.

  Comments are identified using the tokenize module.
    - Single-lined comments begin with the '#' character and end with a line-break
    - Multi-lined comments or docstrings, which are just triple-quoted strings (start 
      and end with ''' or 3 of these "), are told apart from regular strings by the 
      type of the previous token which should be a line-break or an indentation (NEWLINE, 
      NL, INDENT or DEDENT) or no token at all (it would mean it's the fisrt thing in 
      the script). Even in cases like this: 
        
        my_string = \
        '''this should not be considered a comment'''

        my_string = \
          '''this should not either''' # <- notice the increasing indentation

        my_string = \
            '''weird syntax anyway''' # <- but still valid indentation
      
      the previous token to the string is the '=' operator and not a line-break or an  
      indentation. So, only triple-quoted strings preceded by a line-break, an indentation, 
      or no token, will be considered intended as comments.

  Args:
    code: String containing code to extract comments from.
  Returns:
    Python list of common.Comment in the order that they appear in the code.
  Raises:
    tokenize.TokenError
